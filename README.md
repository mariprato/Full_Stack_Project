### Screenshots of Web Application

### Future Development

- Search feature
- Map
- Found process - do we move as a success story, can anyone click found.
- Login to a user account e.g. so that only the user can mark their pet as ‘found’ and so that people can contact users via their account rather than the Fur-ever Found team.
- Make the page responsive for mobile too.
- Login/Register to remove the need for the Fur-Ever Found team to act as a liaison.
